**University of Toronto | Computer Science Specialist & Math Major**

I am an undergraduate student passionate about building practical tools and modding games. While I mostly work with **Python** and **JavaScript**, I have recently been focusing on **C** for Operating Systems development.

This repository hosts my academic coursework alongside a collection of personal projects.
